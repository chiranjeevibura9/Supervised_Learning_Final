# Supervised Learning Final Project 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **supervised learning** techniques to classify text documents into **20 different categories**. Three machine learning models were tested:

- **Naïve Bayes** 📊
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear Kernel** ⚡
- **Random Forest** 🌲

The **SVM model** achieved the highest accuracy and was further optimized using **hyperparameter tuning**.
